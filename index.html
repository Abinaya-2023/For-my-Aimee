    <!-- EVENT 1 -->
    <div class="event">
      <strong>Oct 11, 2025 — Meeting You on Schmooze</strong><br>
      Meeting you online for the first time and talking for hours. I still remember your first text asking if “A” stood for Amazing. From that day, we moved to Instagram and talked endlessly about placements, jobs and the roles I liked. You said swiping right on Schmooze came with benefits - including a referral 😂. You even planned a hiring strategy and made it your mission to land me a job before Nov 1 (my birthday). You called it “Mission Jobs.” I started calling you Batman from day one.

    <!-- EVENT 2 -->
    <div class="event">
      <strong>Oct 12, 2025 — First Google Meet</strong><br>
      You asked me out before leaving to Delhi, but I had classes. We talked about pets, your wish to be a pet owner someday and my placement journey. Then we had our first Google Meet to discuss my resume. I heard your voice for the first time - calm, reassuring and warm.

    <!-- EVENT 3 -->
    <div class="event">
      <strong>Oct 13, 2025 — Instagram Blend & WhatsApp Beginnings</strong><br>
      You sent me an Instagram Blend request, shared referrals and I gave you my number. That day, we started talking on WhatsApp - all night till 2 AM, turning Oct 13 into Oct 14 effortlessly. You called me “Mommy” and said I gave Monica Geller vibes. From that day, we were the same team 💪 #OneTeam

    <!-- EVENT 4 -->
    <div class="event">
      <strong>Oct 15, 2025 (near 1 AM) — First Voice Note</strong><br>
      You had a flight to Delhi and I had classes the next day. We made a bet about whether you’d reach the airport early - and you did, proving once again that you’re a gentleman. We waited to see the flight direction, hoping it would fly over Anna University. That night, you started calling me Bee. You talked about being my boyfriend, your no-divorce policy 😂, kids and how both families should be happy. I shared my family story and my conditions too. #OneTeam

    <!-- EVENT 5 -->
    <div class="event">
      <strong>Oct 16, 2025 — “Are You Not Scared?”</strong><br>
      After endless flirting, criteria discussions and even a SWOT analysis, you asked me if I was scared of waking up next to you for the next 50 years. You asked for 7 kisses a day - every day. You said you were my safe space and not like other people.

    </div>

    <!-- EVENT 6 -->
    <div class="event">
      <strong>Oct 17, 2025 — The Code Word “Green Lantern”</strong><br>
      After stories and your idea of a perfect date, you introduced the code word “Green Lantern.” You explained the Kamal Haasan reference from Vettaiyadu Vilaiyadu and told me you liked me.
      <img src="event6.jpeg">
    </div>

    <!-- EVENT 7 -->
    <div class="event">
      <strong>Oct 18, 2025 — “I Missed You”</strong><br>
      After I cleared something with my friend, we spoke again. You said you missed me the entire day and wanted to tell me you loved me. You said you had the most genuine conversations with me. I felt so happy like I had returned home.
      <img src="event7.jpg">
    </div>

    <!-- EVENT 8 -->
    <div class="event">
      <strong>Oct 22, 2025 — Asking to Meet You</strong><br>
      After realizing my overthinking was unnecessary and that I truly liked you, I asked if we could meet within an hour without wasting your time. You agreed, kindly and happily. That decision changed everything and it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. And if I was given another chance to choose, I would definitely do the same.
      <img src="event8.jpeg">
    </div>

    <!-- EVENT 9 -->
    <div class="event">
      <strong>Oct 28, 2025 — First Call, First Date, First Gift</strong><br>
      You reached Chennai, shaved your beard because I liked it that way, and called me to calm my nerves - our first call. You took me to Ciclo Café, gifted me a pink rose crochet, asked the question, sent the Green Lantern and we officially became us. Pure happiness.

    </div>

    <!-- EVENT 10 -->
    <div class="event">
      <strong>Oct 30, 2025 — Nee Kavithaigala</strong><br>
      You played Nee Kavithaigala for me - my favorite gift ever. We went to Soy Soy, held hands, kissed and I told you that day that we were going to marry each other.
      <img src="event10.jpg">
    </div>

    <!-- EVENT 11 -->
    <div class="event">
      <strong>Nov 1, 2025 — My Birthday</strong><br>
      You were the first to wish me. We started a ritual - you’d always tell me what you were doing at my age. We went to the temple, had breakfast, bought lipstick and a watch and took our first picture together. My happiest birthday.
      <img src="event11.jpeg">
    </div>

    <!-- EVENT 12 -->
    <div class="event">
      <strong>Nov 2, 2025 — Walking, Zaitoon & Us</strong><br>
      After my NPTEL exam, I came to meet you. We walked in Indiranagar Park, you kissed me near the cricket ground and later at Zaitoon we sat close, shared juice, took our favourite blurry picture and I fell in love with you a little more that day.

    <!-- EVENT 13 -->
    <div class="event">
      <strong>Nov 6, 2025 — Our First Kiss</strong><br>
      On my farewell day, I wore a saree and came to meet you. You loved seeing me like that. You held my waist tightly, the rain poured and that’s when we shared our first kiss. I kissed you for the first time too, leaving a lipstick mark on your cheek with the lipstick you bought for me. A perfect first.

    <!-- EVENT 14 -->
    <div class="event">
      <strong>Nov 8, 2025 — Beach Date & First Proper Hug</strong><br>
      We went to the beach together. We walked, talked and you bought me my favorite buns. I hugged you properly for the first time and I smelled like you the entire day. I didn’t want the moment to end.

    </div>

    <!-- EVENT 15 -->
    <div class="event">
      <strong>Nov 11, 2025 — Childhood Pictures</strong><br>
      You shared your childhood photos with me. Seeing you as a child - cute, sweet, soft and innocent made my heart melt. I loved every version of you, including the little one.

    </div>

    <!-- EVENT 16 -->
    <div class="event">
      <strong>Nov 21, 2025 — Twinning for the First Time</strong><br>

    <div class="event">
      <strong>Dec 16, 2025 — Singing for You</strong><br>
      While I was in my hometown, I missed you a lot. I spammed your WhatsApp with songs and love letters. You lovingly called my singing “rhymes” 😂 - but you still listened to every one of them.

    <!-- EVENT 19 -->
    <div class="event">
      <strong>Dec 21, 2025 — My First Flower</strong><br>
